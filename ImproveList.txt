1. In main.py, each hist curve creates a new index. Ideally, theres is only one .
   However, if we build the shibor curve for 20180820, then the curve building function build the index  
   'Shibor'. Then if we build shibor curve for 20180821, 'Shibor' index for 20180821 will be created again,
   which is by no means not neccesary.
